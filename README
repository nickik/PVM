The Goal of this Project is to write a Prototype of an VM that will later run on a PIC Prozessor. The Prototype will be written in Python.

Usecases:

- A way to test the bytecode design
- Test compiler output
- Abstract some of the low level problems like how to map VM registers to PIC Registers and Memory
